WARNING: Copying these UI and settings files will completely overwrite any adjustments you've previously made to graphics settings, hotkeys, window sizes and placements, etc etc. I highly recommend creating a new settings profile for these if you'd like to still experiment with your own setup. To create a settings profile: select a character in the launcher, select the Settings tab on the far right, click the dropdown under Choose Profile, then type a new profile name where it says Default; when finished typing, hit enter and run the client at least once.
